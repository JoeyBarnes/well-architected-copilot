## Well-Architected Copilot for Azure

### Overview

Welcome to the Well-Architected Copilot Hackathon project!
 
The sheer amount of content contained in the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework, Cloud Adoption Framework, Azure Architecture Center, Azure Advisor and various other data sources on best practice guidance can be overwhelming for customers who are trying to discover and adopt these best practices within their workloads.  

The goal of the Well-Architected Copilot for Azure is to utilize modern AI frameworks to provide the customer with a tool that facilitates an intelligent process for aligning workloads to well-architected best practices.
